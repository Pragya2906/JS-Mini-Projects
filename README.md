A collection of small JavaScript projects I built to strengthen core logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling skills.

### Projects Included
- **Color Changer** — changes background colors with button clicks and keyboard interaction.
- **BMI Calculator** — calculates body mass index from input and shows result.
- **Digital Clock** — shows a live updating digital clock.
- **Number Guessing Game** — allows user to guess a random number.
- **Effort Tracker** — effort tracking app that allows users to start and stop timers for individual tasks to understand time spent on each task.

## What I Learned
Each project helped me understand:
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Conditional logic
- Updating UI with JavaScript
